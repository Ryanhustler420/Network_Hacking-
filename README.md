> Definition of 'Hacking'

  - **Definition:** Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose.


# Know yourself - The Threat and Vulnerable Landscape

> Goal

- Foundation Principle of Securities privacy and anonymity. how this principle applies to any given situation and yours personally so you can asses select implement and monitor appropriate security
control to reduce risk . you will understand the relationship between security privacy and anonymity.


> What is Privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity

## Privacy

- which is why some of your assets are important to you. you may want to keep your email private or you may want to keep your identity remain unknown.
privacy is the state of being free from public attention.
but that doesn't mean people don't know you.

``OR``

- the right that someone has to keep their personal life or personal information secret or known only to a small group of people:

``Some Example``

  - You can close this curtain to give you a little more privacy.
  - an invasion of privacy
  - Patients' names have been changed to protect their privacy.
  - I would appreciate it if you would respect my privacy.
  - Famous people often find their privacy is invaded by the press.


## Anonymity

  - When nobody knows who you are but potentially seeing what you do. Anonymity keeps your action and activities separate from your real identity.

  - **nonu[U]** a situation in which a person is not known by or spoken of by name


## Pseudonymity

  - false identity as simple as that.

  - Pseudonymity, a word derived from pseudonym, meaning 'false name', is a state of disguised identity. The pseudonym identifies a holder, that is, one or more human beings who possess but do not disclose their true names (that is, legal identities).

> on of the most Pseudonymitest of modern time is [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) the **creator** of Bitcoin. - on wikipedia

# Security Vulnerabilities Threats and Adversaries (Bookmarked)

  - Now though you know the privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity and that's bring us to **SECURITY**

> ASSETS 

  - The things we really care about and for protecting our assets we use various securities control.
meaning security is degree to which our assets are resistance to **THREATS** from our **ADVERSARIES**
and we select security control based on the type of threads and the adversary that we face
threads are bad things that can happen like a malware attack or mass survalence etc.. all are given ðŸ‘‡ in image
and these threats are enable by our adversaries which might be hackers cyber criminals etc etc.. 

and you can see those red tringle on the image those are vulnerability bugs and witnesses in your security controls a threats will try to expose vulnerability in your security to impact your assest.

**for example**

  - Malware infect your computer through the vulnerability of being on **PATCHED**

> here is the formule

``` Risk = (Vulnerabilities X Threats X Consequences) ``` 

  - will be a way to represent in a formula that likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerability in your security controls and Consequences of that is know as **RISK**. Risk to your assest and risk to you. and the threats and **ADVERSARIES** you face these are called your threats landscape. your threats will be individual to you so as you can clearly see security does not absolutely not exist in isolation so your security controls will selected on the base of 
to mitigate the threats and adversaries and the Consequences of that realisation 

**for exapmle** 

  - you might select **TOR** as a security control to help mitigate threat or mass survalance from **Oppressive Regimes**
or you might choose **TOR** because the Consequences are high in terms of your identity and once your identity is know your Consequences will be realised so you most implement security control to protect your assets to ensure privacy and anonymity and pseudonymity if you require it.

    - Security is a technology
    - Security is an action
    - Security is a process

# Threat Modelling and Risk Assessments


before moving forward lets clear these Core points

  - **Vulnerability:** In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a Threat Actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness..

  - **Threat:** A threat, in the context of computer security, refers to anything that has the potential to cause serious harm to a computer system. A threat is something that may or may not happen, but has the potential to cause serious damage. Threats can lead to attacks on computer systems, networks and more.

  - **Consequences** Consequences. To every action identified as a crime come the penalties or consequences stipulated by law. The penalties are stipulated according to the degree of damage deemed resultant from the crime. The hacking is punished under the statutes for computer criminal acts.

  - **Adversaries** [read here](http://www.centurylink.com/business/enterprise/blog/thinkgig/four-types-cybersecurity-adversaries-defend/)

**First thing First** You can not have a 100% Security Just like you never have 0% Risk you can never completely protect your assets
or maintain perfect privacy and have total anon and have you seen anyone who has 100% security than they simply lying to you.

![Risk Assessments](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Threat%20Modeling%20and%20Risk%20Assessments.png)

every where is risk and the problem is engaging with network is risk engaging with people has a risk.

we take these risk with great Opportunity and benefits so the Internet brings. in order to exploit the Opportunity of using the internet we have  to accept a level of risk. and you need to personally decide what is your tolerance to risk based on your circumstances the lower tolerance risk you have
i.e. if the consequences of loss of security privacy or anonymity is high than the more security control you need. the more advance and optimal
restricted to usability security controls you will want. the higher tolerance risk you have i.e. the consequences might be low the less security control you need. so the security is balance between usability and security between risk and opportunity and security often gets into the way of ease of use
which is why we most choose Security controls that fits our purpose and inline with our appetite risk.

you should take always risk based approach to your securities. we know we can't have 100% security. to apply the right level security
to mitigate the risk to be overburden point where system is unusable. the only you can choose how big burdensome your security needs to be protect your assets. in order to take risk based approach to security than you should do basic threat modelling and risk Assessments when selecting your security controls so, Lets go Through so Assessments process now.

> RISK = (vulnerabilities X Threat X Consequences)

1.  Assets - you should have list of your assets that you want to protect
2.  Vulnerabilities
3.  Threats - you must have some understanding of what Threats are.
4.  Adversaries - you must have some understanding of what Adversaries are.
5.  Consequences - determining the consequences of assets being compromise of threats being realise. when it comes to your assets consider lost or stolen destroyed or encrypted so you cant use them placed on the internet puts in the hands of your adversaries, criminals hackers how could impact your reputation , your privacy your anonymity will be loss. focus on **consequences** if you threat and adversaries are less tangible.

> security controls  we will see later

1.  Select
2.  Implement
3.  Assess
4.  Monitor


# Security vs Privacy vs Anonymity  - Can we have it all

Can some time being contradiction to each other for Example:-

a feature in your browser might check every site that you visit to see if its a know malware distribution site
this feature helps securities because it stops you going to those site which content malware. but can potentially interfere
your privacy and Anonymity as the site malware distribution site is maintaining contact with your browser and could be constaintely updating on what sites that you are vising and when.

the amount of privacy and Anonymity you require is directly prepositional to the amount of security you need.
the more privacy and Anonymity the more security controls

# Defence In Depth

there is a principle in security called **Defence In Depth**.
The Idea is to provide layers of Defences so, one defence fails the other defence
protects you in its place.
so there are three main types of defence that you can think of

![Defence in Depth](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Defence%20in%20Depth.png)

1.  Prevent - this for example can be if you encrypt your files and make sure the key or password isn't available so the **Prevent Defence**
stop people compromising those files and accessing critical information.

2.  Detection  - Detection could be cannery which is planting a divert trap  to the hacker or malware triggers this cannery or trap so you notified that something is the mess

3.  Recovery  - Recovery is like backup or having a ability to Recovery lost file or lost account the principle is what
you cannot Prevent you detect and what you cannot detect you Recover.


> all you need is right technology and the right place

# The Zero Trust Model

Who and what you trust is the key for your security, privacy and anonymity. the less you trust the lower your risk. you want to minimize the number of things that you trust including yourself. This is the **ZERO TRUST MODEL**. To protect your Assets we have to make choice's about trust we have to select software, o/s, encryptions, storage, ISP, Password Manager what download you wanna download and even people that we have to trust to protect our Assets Evaluate Instead of trusting. every thing will represent a level of risk some acceptable and some of 'em not. we can mitigate the risk by distributing the trust this is the zero trust Model. Its should be applied everything we go through in this Tutorial

Trust nothing Trust No one Just evaluate and distribute the trust. well what is that really means!


**for Example**

  - say you want to save file online. you want to sync your file online than first you need to select providers that offer the syncing service
    - Dropbox - is a popular choice for most of people. still you should not trust that they will not get hacked. you should not trust that they wont view your file. you should not trust that they will lose or change your file. so you have to make a risk base choice based on that zero trust model
  - you should ask yourself how important is it that the file remain private without being changed and will always available. you decide that it is important so you choose that backup of the file as well in a separate location and encrypt the file with use a service to encrypt the files client side with a decryption key the only you have this way you have distributed the trust to the alternative backup and to yourself by encryptions

  - Crypton & ENCRYPTR are called Zero Knowledge System. Zero knowledge meaning when provider has zero knowledge about what it is that they are hosting for there client

  [Let us see an example] -> applications can have secrete backdoors you may choose to run an application in a isolated virtual machine to stop it being able to communicated out. application can have malwares again it may sandbox that application instead of trusting in your evaluating you mitigating the risk by distributing the trust.
