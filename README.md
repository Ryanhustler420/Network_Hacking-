> Definition of 'Hacking'

  - **Definition:** Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose.


## Know yourself - The Threat and Vulnerable Landscape

> Goal

- Foundation Principle of Securities privacy and anonymity. how this principle applies to any given situation and yours personally so you can asses select implement and monitor appropriate security
control to reduce risk . you will understand the relationship between security privacy and anonymity.


> What is Privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity

## Privacy

- which is why some of your assets are important to you. you may want to keep your email private or you may want to keep your identity remain unknown.
privacy is the state of being free from public attention.
but that doesn't mean people don't know you.

``OR``

- the right that someone has to keep their personal life or personal information secret or known only to a small group of people:

``Some Example``

  - You can close this curtain to give you a little more privacy.
  - an invasion of privacy
  - Patients' names have been changed to protect their privacy.
  - I would appreciate it if you would respect my privacy.
  - Famous people often find their privacy is invaded by the press.


## Anonymity

  - When nobody knows who you are but potentially seeing what you do. Anonymity keeps your action and activities separate from your real identity.

  - **nonu[U]** a situation in which a person is not known by or spoken of by name


## Pseudonymity

  - false identity as simple as that.

  - Pseudonymity, a word derived from pseudonym, meaning 'false name', is a state of disguised identity. The pseudonym identifies a holder, that is, one or more human beings who possess but do not disclose their true names (that is, legal identities).

# Security Vulnerabilities Threats and Adversaries (Bookmarked)

  - Now though you know the privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity and that's bring us to **SECURITY**

> ASSETS 

  - The things we really care about and for protecting our assets we use various securities control.
meaning security is degree to which our assets are resistance to **THREATS** from our **ADVERSARIES**
and we select security control based on the type of threads and the adversary that we face
threads are bad things that can happen like a malware attack or mass survalence etc.. all are given 👇 in image
and these threats are enable by our adversaries which might be hackers cyber criminals etc etc.. 

and you can see those red tringle on the image those are vulnerability bugs and witnesses in your security controls a threats will try to expose vulnerability in your security to impact your assest.

**for example**

  - Malware infect your computer through the vulnerability of being on **PATCHED**

> here is the formule

``` Risk = (Vulnerabilities X Threats X Consequences) ``` 

  - will be a way to represent in a formula that likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerability in your security controls and Consequences of that is know as **RISK**. Risk to your assest and risk to you. and the threats and **ADVERSARIES** you face these are called your threats landscape. your threats will be individual to you so as you can clearly see security does not absolutely not exist in isolation so your security controls will selected on the base of 
to mitigate the threats and adversaries and the Consequences of that realisation 

**for exapmle** 

  - you might select **TOR** as a security control to help mitigate threat or mass survalance from **Oppressive Regimes**
or you might choose **TOR** because the Consequences are high in terms of your identity and once your identity is know your Consequences will be realised so you most implement security control to protect your assets to ensure privacy and anonymity and pseudonymity if you require it.

    - Security is a technology
    - Security is an action
    - Security is a process

# Threat Modelling and Risk Assessments


before moving forward lets clear these Core points

  - **Vulnerability:** In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a Threat Actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness..

  - **Threat:** A threat, in the context of computer security, refers to anything that has the potential to cause serious harm to a computer system. A threat is something that may or may not happen, but has the potential to cause serious damage. Threats can lead to attacks on computer systems, networks and more.

  - **Consequences** Consequences. To every action identified as a crime come the penalties or consequences stipulated by law. The penalties are stipulated according to the degree of damage deemed resultant from the crime. The hacking is punished under the statutes for computer criminal acts.

  - **Adversaries** [read here](http://www.centurylink.com/business/enterprise/blog/thinkgig/four-types-cybersecurity-adversaries-defend/)

**First thing First** You can not have a 100% Security Just like you never have 0% Risk you can never completely protect your assets
or maintain perfect privacy and have total anon and have you seen anyone who has 100% security than they simply lying to you.

![Risk Assessments](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Threat%20Modeling%20and%20Risk%20Assessments.png)

every where is risk and the problem is engaging with network is risk engaging with people has a risk.

we take these risk with great Opportunity and benefits so the Internet brings. in order to exploit the Opportunity of using the internet we have  to accept a level of risk. and you need to personally decide what is your tolerance to risk based on your circumstances the lower tolerance risk you have
i.e. if the consequences of loss of security privacy or anonymity is high than the more security control you need. the more advance and optimal
restricted to usability security controls you will want. the higher tolerance risk you have i.e. the consequences might be low the less security control you need. so the security is balance between usability and security between risk and opportunity and security often gets into the way of ease of use
which is why we most choose Security controls that fits our purpose and inline with our appetite risk.

you should take always risk based approach to your securities. we know we can't have 100% security. to apply the right level security
to mitigate the risk to be overburden point where system is unusable. the only you can choose how big burdensome your security needs to be protect your assets. in order to take risk based approach to security than you should do basic threat modelling and risk Assessments when selecting your security controls so, Lets go Through so Assessments process now.

> RISK = (vulnerabilities X Threat X Consequences)

1.  Assets - you should have list of your assets that you want to protect
2.  Vulnerabilities
3.  Threats - you must have some understanding of what Threats are.
4.  Adversaries - you must have some understanding of what Adversaries are.
5.  Consequences - determining the consequences of assets being compromise of threats being realise. when it comes to your assets consider lost or stolen destroyed or encrypted so you cant use them placed on the internet puts in the hands of your adversaries, criminals hackers how could impact your reputation , your privacy your anonymity will be loss. focus on **consequences** if you threat and adversaries are less tangible.

> security controls  we will see later

1.  Select
2.  Implement
3.  Assess
4.  Monitor


# Security vs Privacy vs Anonymity  - Can we have it all

Can some time being contradiction to each other for Example:-

a feature in your browser might check every site that you visit to see if its a know malware distribution site
this feature helps securities because it stops you going to those site which content malware. but can potentially interfere
your privacy and Anonymity as the site malware distribution site is maintaining contact with your browser and could be constaintely updating on what sites that you are vising and when.

the amount of privacy and Anonymity you require is directly prepositional to the amount of security you need.
the more privacy and Anonymity the more security controls

![ImageQuote](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Security%20vs%20Privacy%20vs%20Anonymity%20%20-%20Can%20we%20have%20it%20all.png)

# Defence In Depth

there is a principle in security called **Defence In Depth**.
The Idea is to provide layers of Defences so, one defence fails the other defence
protects you in its place.
so there are three main types of defence that you can think of

![Defence in Depth](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Defence%20in%20Depth.png)

1.  Prevent - this for example can be if you encrypt your files and make sure the key or password isn't available so the **Prevent Defence**
stop people compromising those files and accessing critical information.

2.  Detection  - Detection could be cannery which is planting a divert trap  to the hacker or malware triggers this cannery or trap so you notified that something is the mess

3.  Recovery  - Recovery is like backup or having a ability to Recovery lost file or lost account the principle is what
you cannot Prevent you detect and what you cannot detect you Recover.


> all you need is right technology and the right place

# The Zero Trust Model

Who and what you trust is the key for your security, privacy and anonymity. the less you trust the lower your risk. you want to minimize the number of things that you trust including yourself. This is the **ZERO TRUST MODEL**. To protect your Assets we have to make choice's about trust we have to select software, o/s, encryptions, storage, ISP, Password Manager what download you wanna download and even people that we have to trust to protect our Assets Evaluate Instead of trusting. every thing will represent a level of risk some acceptable and some of 'em not. we can mitigate the risk by distributing the trust this is the zero trust Model. Its should be applied everything we go through in this Tutorial

Trust nothing Trust No one Just evaluate and distribute the trust. well what is that really means!


**for Example**

  - say you want to save file online. you want to sync your file online than first you need to select providers that offer the syncing service
    - Dropbox - is a popular choice for most of people. still you should not trust that they will not get hacked. you should not trust that they wont view your file. you should not trust that they will lose or change your file. so you have to make a risk base choice based on that zero trust model
  - you should ask yourself how important is it that the file remain private without being changed and will always available. you decide that it is important so you choose that backup of the file as well in a separate location and encrypt the file with use a service to encrypt the files client side with a decryption key the only you have this way you have distributed the trust to the alternative backup and to yourself by encryptions

  - Crypton & ENCRYPTR are called Zero Knowledge System. Zero knowledge meaning when provider has zero knowledge about what it is that they are hosting for there client

  [Let us see an example] -> applications can have secrete backdoors you may choose to run an application in a isolated virtual machine to stop it being able to communicated out. application can have malwares again it may sandbox that application instead of trusting in your evaluating you mitigating the risk by distributing the trust.

# If There’s Value, They Will Hack It

Have you ever wondered what a hacked computer, email address, or other online account is even worth? Sure, it seems pretty obvious that there’d be some serious value in a compromised online bank or PayPal account, but what about Facebook or Skype or any of the other myriad of online services?

![Hack](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2013/06/05095329/value_title.jpg)

There are at least two ways in which we can enumerate this value. One of those ways is financial: what is the market value of a hacked account? However, these accounts are also valuable for their worth to social engineers. In other words, how can they be used in phishing attacks designed to compromise the other things that criminals compromise?

Lucky for us, Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter and one of the most well-respected journalists in the industry, published a chart illustrating the value of hacked machines a few years back on his own news site, **Krebs on Security**. He has revisited the idea a few times including an evaluation of the values of hacked email and other accounts. Following Krebs’ lead, **the SANS Institute has elaborated on this idea in a whole slew of languages**. The SANS chart is below:

![chart](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2013/06/05095326/STH-Poster-YouAreATarget-LowResolution.jpg)

Let’s start with the direct financial value of various accounts estimated by Krebs’s based on his tendency to trawl through the sketchy black-market forums in which they are sold. He claims that a prominent seller of this stuff charges $8 for iTunes accounts; $6 for Fedex.com, Continental.com, and United.com accounts; $5 for Groupon accounts; $4 for Godaddy accounts; and a measly $2.50 for active Facebook and Twitter accounts. I’m sure these prices jump a bit if the accounts belong to valuable targets, like diplomats, prominent business people, celebrities, defense contractors, and others. In a separate piece based on a different marketplace, Krebs found Dell, Overstock, Walmart, Tesco, BestBuy, Target and other online retail accounts worth between $1 and $3.

The funny thing about hacked PayPal and online bank accounts is that their value isn’t as straight forward as you might think. Let’s say you’ve got $2000 in a bank account or on a credit card or available on PayPal. The value of that account would be two grand, right? Not really. The criminals that compromise these accounts do it on a wholesale level. They usually aren’t compromising and emptying the accounts themselves. To do so is simply too labor intensive and too risky. Instead, they hack the account, and sell access to it on these same underground, black-market forums.

> A criminal with access to your primary email account can likely reset the passwords to and take control of every other account you own.

Another popular way to make money on a compromised financial account is to use money mules. In these cases your account is pretty much worth what’s in it, but it’s kind of a different animal altogether. Very briefly, money mule operators put out advertisements offering easy money to anyone that will remove money from a bank account and wire it off to wherever the criminal is located. The crooks running these scams aren’t advertising for money mules, but the people that accept these offers are, without their knowledge, acting as money mules. Oftentimes they are not paid after withdrawing and moving the money.

Email and financial accounts are harder to evaluate because much of their value depends upon the contents of the accounts and the identity of their rightful owner, which makes this a pretty good place to transition into the non-financial value of hacked accounts. Email accounts are often the hub through which every other account is controlled. When you forget a password, you reset it through your email account. My passwords are often so unique and so good that I have no option but to reset them through my email because I’ll never remember them otherwise.

A hacked email account is also a danger to every single one of your contacts. The same logic can be applied to your various social media accounts. These people you connect with trust you. If a malicious link comes in a phishing email from a known email account, your contacts or friends or connections will probably open it, and that is on you. You’ll have to live with the fact that your lazy security practices sunk someone else’s ship and I hope you lose sleep over it! Just kidding, I hope you practice strong security and never run into these problems.

## Top 10 Internet Safety Rules & What Not to Do Online

![chartWhatExpertsSaysAndNonExpertsSays](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Top%203%20Rules.png)

1. Keep Personal Information Professional and Limited
Potential employers or customers don't need to know your personal relationship status or your home address. They do need to know about your expertise and professional background, and how to get in touch with you. You wouldn't hand purely personal information out to strangers individually—don't hand it out to millions of people online.

2. Keep Your Privacy Settings On
Marketers love to know all about you, and so do hackers. Both can learn a lot from your browsing and social media usage. But you can take charge of your information. As noted by Lifehacker, both web browsers and mobile operating systems have settings available to protect your privacy online. Major websites like Facebook also have privacy-enhancing settings available. These settings are sometimes (deliberately) hard to find because companies want your personal information for its marketing value. Make sure you have enabled these privacy safeguards, and keep them enabled.

3. Practice Safe Browsing
You wouldn't choose to walk through a dangerous neighborhood—don't visit dangerous neighborhoods online. Cybercriminals use lurid content as bait. They know people are sometimes tempted by dubious content and may let their guard down when searching for it. The Internet's demimonde is filled with hard-to-see pitfalls, where one careless click could expose personal data or infect your device with malware. By resisting the urge, you don't even give the hackers a chance.

4. Make Sure Your Internet Connection is Secure
When you go online in a public place, for example by using a public Wi-Fi connection, PCMag notes you have no direct control over its security. Corporate cybersecurity experts worry about "endpoints"—the places where a private network connects to the outside world. Your vulnerable endpoint is your local Internet connection. Make sure your device is secure, and when in doubt, wait for a better time (i.e., until you're able to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network) before providing information such as your bank account number.

5. Be Careful What You Download
A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. As PCWorld advises, don't download apps that look suspicious or come from a site you don't trust.

6. Choose Strong Passwords
Passwords are one of the biggest weak spots in the whole Internet security structure, but there's currently no way around them. And the problem with passwords is that people tend to choose easy ones to remember (such as "password" and "123456"), which are also easy for cyber thieves to guess. Select strong passwords that are harder for cybercriminals to demystify. Password manager software can help you to manage multiple passwords so that you don't forget them. A strong password is one that is unique and complex—at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special characters.

7. Make Online Purchases From Secure Sites
Any time you make a purchase online, you need to provide credit card or bank account information—just what cybercriminals are most eager to get their hands on. Only supply this information to sites that provide secure, encrypted connections. As Boston University notes, you can identify secure sites by looking for an address that starts with https: (the S stands for secure) rather than simply http: They may also be marked by a padlock icon next to the address bar.

8. Be Careful What You Post
The Internet does not have a delete key, as that young candidate in New Hampshire found out. Any comment or image you post online may stay online forever because removing the original (say, from Twitter) does not remove any copies that other people made. There is no way for you to "take back" a remark you wish you hadn't made, or get rid of that embarrassing selfie you took at a party. Don't put anything online that you wouldn't want your mom or a prospective employer to see.

9. Be Careful Who You Meet Online
People you meet online are not always who they claim to be. Indeed, they may not even be real. As InfoWorld reports, fake social media profiles are a popular way for hackers to cozy up to unwary Web users and pick their cyber pockets. Be as cautious and sensible in your online social life as you are in your in-person social life.

10. Keep Your Antivirus Program Up To Date
Internet security software cannot protect against every threat, but it will detect and remove most malware—though you should make sure it's to date. Be sure to stay current with your operating system's updates and updates to applications you use. They provide a vital layer of security.

Keep these 10 basic Internet safety rules in mind and you'll avoid many of the nasty surprises that lurk online for the careless.

## Security Bugs and Vulnerabilities

Security bug. A security bug or security defect is a software bug that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or privileges on a computer system. Security bugs introduce security vulnerabilities by compromising one or more of: Authentication of users and other entities. [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_bug)

## Hackers crackers and cyber criminals

![Diffrence](https://www.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hackers-vs-crackers-infographics.jpg)

**All about Hackers**
The original use of the term hacker dates back to 1950s when at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology some students had a strong desire of experimenting and learning about technology. A hack back then meant something very original and ingenious and solely meant to explore the arena of computers and technology. Currently the terms is used in a rather negative sense. And this is because most of the times people confuse the term hacking with cracking. But it is totally not to be confused with crackers. We will deal with the crackers in detail later.

**White Hats**, 
as they are sometimes called are mostly the programmers. They acquire an advanced knowledge of programming, computer languages and codes. They are the ethical hackers who stay within the limits of the law. They do not access any system or network illegally. They are constantly looking for the flaws in the computer and internet security and their sole aim is to rectify these flaws and improve the security of the content. The companies hire these white hats in order to audit and check their network security. These hackers work as professionals and correct the flaws with their advanced knowledge of the area and reduce the risk that might put the security of the company at stake. They discover the weak points in the network securities and work tirelessly and put in their best efforts to seek solutions to these network issues. They establish the reason behind these loopholes and work for fixing them.

**What interests these Hackers:**
The hackers are interested in knowing how things work. They like to explore and discover the computer systems, programming and the networks. While some hackers may only be interested in learning the things others turn their passion into their profession thus making them professional hackers. They are essentially very well acquainted with all sorts of software tools, techniques and codes that the crackers know. They know how a cracker would attempt to attack any content which is meant to be secure on the websites and across computer systems. They design exactly such software and tools that a cracker would use and then they work on improving the system with more secure tools and techniques. This ensure that the computer systems and the network systems become secure enough to not be thwarted by the crackers.  The white hats also break in the security but their purpose of breaking in is entirely non-malicious. They do this only to test their own systems for security purposes and they do it legally with the permission of various companies and firms that hire them for this job. White hats come under the banner of ethical hacking which doesn’t involve any illegal practice of hacking. The professional hackers mean no harm to any company or individual.

**All About Crackers**
We have learnt about the hackers, how they work, what their interests are and what they do. Now when we talk of crackers, we must know that crackers are also hackers. But their ways of works differ a lot. While a hacker works totally in the interest of a company or an individual, the cracker works totally in an opposite manner. The purpose of a cracker is to break the security of computers and networks. It is an illegal activity. They make use of their knowledge to make personal gains and breach the security across networks. They acquire extensive knowledge and learning about computers, their programming, software, codes and languages and use them to break into computers for criminal gains.

The crackers are also known as Black Hats. They gain access to the accounts of people maliciously and they can misuse the secured information across networks. They can steal credit card information, they can destroy important files, disclose crucial data and information or personal details and sell them for personal gains. Their purpose can range from little personal gains to bigger criminal interests. They can make employees of a company divulge highly secure information. They violate computer security. Once they have gained the control over a system, they can do anything like steel data, destroy it, use it to their advantage etc.

**What interests these Crackers:**
While some crackers are driven by sheer publicity of their abilities in the field of hacking, some do it for criminal and malicious purposes. They intentionally breach the computer and network security merely for profit or maybe there is challenge in it. They are interested in gaining access to various programs and softwares without paying royalties. The only purpose they have is illegal hacking leading to security problems. There may be a theft from the accounts of credit card holders, important data may be lost and secure information may be divulged. Some crackers are interested in modifying the softwares by reverse engineering. And they do this merely for amusement or to showcase their knowledge and abilities.

**Types of Crackers:**
There are various types of crackers that include script kiddies, packet monkeys, s’kiddiots, lamers, warez d00dz (dudes), and wannabes. Usually they are less skilled and do not possess necessary in-depth knowledge about programming and codes. They, almost always rely on the software tools created by others to carry out their operations. Most of the times they do not know what these program really do. They only know the process of cracking the security networks and they lack the advanced knowledge. They are not much of a threat but their threats cannot be ignored. They basically deface the web pages and replace them with their designs.

**Hackers vs Crackers**
There is a common view that the hackers build things and the crackers break the things. These are basically two entirely different terms. They may seem similar but there are differences between how the two actually work. While hackers have an advanced knowledge of the computer related security crackers usually are not as skillful as hackers. Very few of them are skilled enough to create their new software and tools. So they generally rely on certain not so reputed, in fact the disrepute websites to download several automated programs to execute their deed. Hackers try to counter the potential threats that the crackers pose to the computer and internet security across varied networks. Crackers always know that their activities are illegal and they are breaking the law so they tend to cover up their tracks.

However the professional hackers being competent enough and quite skillful with their work, potentially restore the security set ups across the corrupted networks and they help in catching the specific crackers. Although most of the crackers are less skilled yet many of them are able enough. They possess advanced skills and extensive knowledge just like the professional hackers. They have the ability to create tools and software that help them exploit all sorts of weak points that they discover in the highly secured programs. This makes it even difficult to catch these crackers. Because they do not leave a trail behind. The number of skilled crackers is very low yet we should not ignore them. They certainly pose serious threat to the internet security.

By now we are well aware that the hackers are the ethical professionals while the crackers break into the security systems unethically and illegally. Besides this ethical difference one of the major differences between the two is their understanding of computer systems and the security systems. Their ability and inability to create programs and software tools is a major difference between the two. The hackers can write codes in multiple languages. They have an upper hand when it comes to the knowledge of various computer languages like **C, C++, HTML, Java** etc. also they have a complete understanding of what these codes do and how these software work. Crackers on the other hand are inept when t comes to computer programs. They boast about their abilities to break into the security systems and use it to their advantage. The difference here is clear. The crackers breaks into the secure networks for malicious purposes while a professional hacker does not. So therefore, it is just how they work which makes them entirely different from each other.

We can thus conclude to say that the Hackers break into the security systems for the sole purpose of checking the holes in the system and works on rectifying these while as the Cracker breaks into the security system for criminal and illegal reasons or for personal gains. The white hats perform the security tests according to a legal contract. The black hats do not follow any such agreement. They do so to violate the security of the systems. While a cracker keeps the knowledge of any vulnerability n a security system to himself and uses it to his own advantage, the hacker does so in order to aware the concerned company or an individual about the possible breaking that could lead them to considerable losses at the hands of the Crackers. So basically we can go on to say that the ethical hackers use and apply their knowledge and experience in order to help maintain the security of a computer system and a network.

While the crackers use their knowledge, which generally is not much advanced, to break the law? The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably but we have to know this that the difference between the two is quite big and considerable. We might even say that this is respectful to be a hacker and insulting to be a cracker. Hacking is generally potentially more harmful than cracking because the hackers possess in depth knowledge of the programs and codes etc. However, since the hackers work solely for developing the security systems they really do not possess any threats to the security systems. The crackers however, possess serious threats to the internet security. And this is a growing menace in the current times. Therefore it is significant to take proper legal action against the prosecutors and thus reduce the threats. The two terms are significantly similar but the difference lies in the manner each tends to work. That is what makes the two so different. Therefore we must not confuse these two terms and remember to do hacking legally and ethically and never ever think of going towards cracking.

## Malware, Virus, Rootkits, Spyware, Worm, Trojans and RAT (remote access Trojan)

![malware](https://cdn.guidingtech.com/media/assets/WordPress-Import/2011/12/virus.jpg)

Whenever your computer starts acting weird and makes it difficult for you to work on, the first thing that comes to you mind is whether a virus has affected your computer.

Some of those times, your fears might turn out to be true. Hence it helps to know about these enemies of your computer and get a basic understanding of how they work. That could help you deal with them in a faster & better way.

**Malware** is any malicious program or software that’s designed to exploit a computer user. Malware is basically an umbrella term covering computer viruses, worms, Trojan, spyware, rootkit etc. Some of ‘em attack the computer programs and files while others attack users confidential data. Let’s have a detailed look at their mode of operation.

**WHAT IS A VIRUS**
Just as a biological virus replicates itself in a human cell, a computer virus replicates itself  in computer memory when initiated by the user. Not only they replicate themselves but may also contain some malicious codes which can affect your files, your operating system or even your master boot records thereby making your computer start slow or not boot at all.

There are different types of viruses, some affect the system adversely and leave it completely unusable while some are just written to annoy the user. Disabling task manager or desktop wallpaper is one of the most common ways that virus creators employ to irritate users.

As a virus always needs a human action to initiate itself, in a computer most of them attach themselves to an executable .exe file because it knows eventually the user will double click on it to run it and that’s all it needs to infect the computer. Yes, unfortunately, most viruses are inadvertently initiated by the computer users themselves and hence it is important that when you install and run programs, you know beforehand that you got them from a trusted source.

**This is a worm**

![Worm](https://cdn.guidingtech.com/media/assets/WordPress-Import/2011/12/worm.png)

Practically a worm is an evolved form of a virus. Like virus, worms too replicate and spread themselves but it happens on a bit larger scale. Also, unlike virus, a worm does not need a human action to replicate and spread and that’s what makes it more dangerous.

A worm always seeks for network loopholes to replicate from computer to computer and thus most common way of intrusion are emails and IM attachments.  As the infection is network-based, a good firewall along with antivirus is necessary to control worm attack. Also, this means that blindly downloading email attachments or clicking the links friends share with you in a chat window isn’t recommended. Double-check before you do that.

**WHAT IS A TROJAN HORSE**

![horse](https://cdn.guidingtech.com/media/assets/WordPress-Import/2011/12/Trojan.png)

Trojan horse or simply Trojan is a bit interesting. Trojan horse is a program that appears useful by pretending to do certain things in foreground, but in reality they are working silently in background with the only objective of harming your computer and/or stealing valuable information.

Let me explain this metaphorically.

Suppose you are the CEO of a company and there’s an employee in your firm you think is a valuable asset because of some initial success he gave your company. In reality the employee is working for your competitor and destroying your company from within. Now these kinds of employees can be considered as a Trojan horses if you consider the company as your computer.

Most common way to invite a Trojan horse to your computer is downloading malicious software like keys, cracks, free illegal music, wares etc from an unknown source. Thus the best way to stay away from Trojans is by making sure you install software from trusted sources.

**WHAT IS A SPYWARE**

![spyware](https://cdn.guidingtech.com/media/assets/WordPress-Import/2011/12/spy.png)

Spywares are also malicious computer programs that can be installed on computers but unlike any of the above they don’t harm your computer in any way. Instead, they attack you!

Once installed on a system they run in background and keep on collecting user’s personal data. These data can include your credit card numbers, passwords, important files and many other personal stuff.

Spywares can track your keystrokes, scan and read your computer files, snoop IM chats and emails and God knows what else. Therefore again it’s always advisable to download and install software from trusted sources.

**WHAT IS A ROOTKIT**
Rootkits are computer programs that are designed by attackers to gain root or administrative access to your computer. Once an attacker gains admin privilege, it becomes a cakewalk for him to exploit your system.

We have already discussed rootkit in detail previously and you can have a look at it for in-depth knowledge.

**What is a RAT (remote access Trojan)**

A remote access Trojan (RAT) is a malware program that includes a back door for administrative control over the target computer. RATs are usually downloaded invisibly with a user-requested program -- such as a game -- or sent as an email attachment. Once the host system is compromised, the intruder may use it to distribute RATs to other vulnerable computers and establish a botnet.


Because a RAT enables administrative control, it makes it possible for the intruder to do just about anything on the targeted computer, including:

- Monitoring user behavior through keyloggers or other spyware.
- Accessing confidential information, such as credit card and social security numbers.
- Activating a system's webcam and recording video.
- Taking screenshots.
- Distributing viruses and other malware.
- Formatting drives.
- Deleting, downloading or altering files and file systems.

The Back Orifice rootkit is one of the best known examples of a RAT. A hacker group known as the Cult of the Dead Cow created Back Orifice to expose the security deficiencies of Microsoft's Windows operating systems.

RATs can be difficult to detect because they usually don't show up in lists of running programs or tasks. The actions they perform can be similar to those of legitimate programs. Furthermore, an intruder will often manage the level of resource use so that a drop in performance doesn't alert the user that something's amiss.

To protect your system from RATs, follow the same procedures you use to prevent other malware infections: Keep antivirus software up to date and refrain from downloading programs or opening attachments that aren't from a trusted source. At the administrative level, it's always a good idea to block unused ports, turn off unused services and monitor outgoing traffic.

RAT also stands for remote administration tool.

## Phishing, Pharming, Vishing, and Smishing

**Phishing**
On the Internet, "phishing" refers to criminal activity that attempts to fraudulently obtain sensitive information. There are several ways a fraudster can try to obtain sensitive information such as your social security number, driver's license, credit card information, or bank account information, often luring you with a sense of urgency. Sometimes a fraudster will first send you a benign email (think of this as the bait) to lure you into a conversation and then follow that up with a phishing email. At other times, the fraudster will just send one phishing email that will direct you to a website requesting you to enter your personal information such as User ID and Password.

**Recognizing a fake**

**Here are some questions to ask if you think you have received a phishing email**.  You can use these same questions if you receive a vishing or smishing message: 

![view](https://security.intuit.com/images/Fake-email-example.png)

1.  Do you know the sender of the email?  If yes, continue to be cautious before clicking a link. If no, do not click any links.
2.  Have you checked the link? Mouse over the link and check the URL. Does it look legitimate or does it look like it will take you to a different website?
3.  Does the email contain grammatical errors? If so, be suspicious.
4.  Are there any attachments in the email? If so, do not click on the attachment before contacting the sender to verify its contents.
5.  Does the email request personal information?  If so, do not reply.
6.  If you have a relationship with the company, are they addressing you by name?

**How to validate the email you received came from Intuit and what to do if you think you have received a phishing email:**

To protect your privacy, please do not click any of the links or reply to the malicious email.  When you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from Intuit, please follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your Intuit account.
2.  Access your account's security settings.
3.  Find "Account Activity" and select View.  A history of events involving your account will display.
4.  If you find an event marked with an email icon that matches the content, date, and time of the email you are verifying, you'll know     the email is from Intuit.  you may also see a ref code that can be matched to the email.
5.  If you don't find a match, forward the email immediately to spoof@intuit.com. We will look into each reported instance.

You can also go to Security Alerts where all known phishing emails targeting the Intuit brand are posted. If you find a similar email, please delete the email you received as well as remove it from your trash.  There are no further steps necessary; however, if you do not find a similar email, please forward the email to spoof@intuit.com for further investigation. 

**Pharming**
Pharming is another scam where a fraudster installs malicious code on a personal computer or server. This code then redirects any clicks you make on a website to another fraudulent Website without your consent or knowledge. To avoid pharming, follow the basic computer safety guidelines in Protect Your Computer. Be especially careful when entering financial information on a website. Look for the ‘s’ in https and the key or lock symbol at the bottom of the browser. If the website looks different than when you last visited, be suspicious and don’t click unless you are absolutely certain the site is secure.

**Vishing**

Unfortunately, phishing emails are not the only way people can try to fool you into providing personal information in an effort to steal your identity or commit fraud. Fraudsters also use the phone to solicit your personal information. This telephone version of phishing is sometimes called vishing. Vishing relies on “social engineering” techniques to trick you into providing information that others can use to access and use your important accounts. People can also use this information to assume your identity and open new accounts. 

To avoid being fooled by a vishing attempt:

- If you receive an email or phone call requesting you call them and you suspect it might be a fraudulent request, look up the organization’s customer service number and call that number rather than the number provided in the solicitation email or phone call.

- Forward the solicitation email to the customer service or security email address of the organization, asking whether the email is legitimate.

Though vishing and its relative, phishing, are troublesome crimes and sometimes hard to identify, here are some tips from the FTC to protect your identity. 

**Smishing**
Just like phishing, smishing uses cell phone text messages to lure consumers in. Often the text will contain an URL or phone number. The phone number often has an automated voice response system. And again, just like phishing, the smishing message usually asks for your immediate attention.

In many cases, the smishing message will come from a "5000" number instead of displaying an actual phone number. This usually indicates the text message was sent via email to the cell phone, and not sent from another cell phone.

Do not respond to smishing messages.

## Spamming  Doxing

Internet privacy is a huge deal. One of the stated perks of the Internet is that you can remain anonymous behind your monitor as you browse, chat, and do whatever it is that you do. However, did you know that your real life identity can be compromised based on your Internet persona? It’s called “doxing” and it’ll sneak up on you without your knowledge.

So, what is Doxing? Doxing can affect anyone. Nobody is outside the possibility of being doxed. How much of your real life information is on the Internet? Even the smallest slice of personal data can come back to bite you in the rear. Real name, phone number, email address – anything.

Sound like fearmongering? In one sense, it is. You’ve probably never heard of someone who’s been doxed. But that doesn’t mean you’re immune. Let’s take a closer look at what doxing is, exactly, and then I’ll show you what you can do about it.

![Doxing](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/what-is-doxing-1.jpg)

**Doxing is a term that describes the process of obtaining or deducing information about a person based on a limited set of initial information. Or in layman’s terms, doxing is the act of searching around on the Internet for someone’s personal details. Another way to view doxing is to see it as taking a piece of information (e.g., email address) and identifying someone based on that.**

The term “doxing” derives from “document tracing” which means to gather documents on a particular person or company to learn more about them. In the age of the Internet, doxing is more like social engineering – gathering information on someone using publicly available sources.

**How Doxing Affects You**

![DoxingEffect](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/what-is-doxing-2.jpg)

Whether you know it or not, you’ve probably doxed someone at some point in your life. Remember that party a few years back and you met that really interesting person but you only caught their first name and their profession? Later that night, you went home, hopped on Google, and did a bit of searching to find out who they were.

Okay, maybe it didn’t go exactly like that, but you know what I mean. Most of you have searched for people’s identities using publicly available information, like search results and Facebook profiles. And even if you did dox someone, your intentions were likely innocent.

But if you were able to dox someone else, imagine how many people could be doxing you. Not everyone performs a dox with good intentions in mind.

Recently, Reddit experienced some controversy surrounding a moderator who was doxed. This user was purported to be extremely careful with his usernames and his Internet identity, yet even then someone was able to identify him for who he was. How careful are you with your information?

Consider your Facebook profile. It contains a lot of information on you: your name, birthday, location, friends and family relations, work history, photo albums, schooling information, religious and political affiliations, and more.

And even if your Facebook privacy settings are maxxed out, you’re not as secure as you think. Even if someone got hold of just one thing about you, they could identify you through the Internet.

## Protecting Yourself Against Doxing

![anonymity](https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/what-is-doxing-3.jpg)

So what can you do to best protect yourself against doxing attempts? First, here are some of the most commonly targeted pieces of information that can be freely gleaned from the Internet and used to identify you:

- **Full name**
- **Gender, birthday, and age**
- **Location**
- **Email addresses**
- **IP addresses**
- **Usernames**
- **Social networking profiles**
- **Websites and blogs**

Whenever possible, keep these information bits private and hidden. Sometimes you can’t, but whenever possible, do it. As for specific steps that you can take, here are some of the more effective ones:

**Make All Internet Profiles Private**

This means that you need to go on Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and whatever else search engine and type in your usernames, your full name, your email addresses, etc. Pretend as if you were doxing yourself. Find all the instances of your data online, then go and make those profiles private! If you can, delete them.

**Maximize Social Network Privacy Settings**

Tina once compiled a list of **5 must-know critical Facebook privacy tips**. Live by those tips. Set as much as you can to private. If there are social networking sites you no longer use, delete or disable those profiles. Organize your information and don’t post any sensitive information in your profile fields.

**Create Multiple Usernames & Email Addresses**

If you like to play video games, use a separate username for video game accounts. If you participate in forums, use a public username that you’ll only use for forums. When it comes to online banking, bill payments, loan statements, use a different username that is never public. Make it so that it’s really difficult for people to cross-reference you across multiple sites. Apply the same line of thought to email addresses.

**Don’t Make Enemies**

The people who are most likely to dox you in a malicious way are those who have something against you. Common sense, I know, but it’s easy to think that you can hide behind Internet anonymity and get away with being a jerk. Don’t be a jerk, don’t be a troll, don’t do or say anything you wouldn’t do or say in person. Basically, don’t give anyone a reason to dox you in the first place.

**But at the end of the day, you must surrender to the fact that if you do anything on the Internet, you will always leave a trail. The goal is to leave as small and inconspicuous of a trail as you can so that the trail is difficult to follow back to you. Hopefully now you know how to reduce the likelihood of you being doxed!**

## social engineering

**WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING**

Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim’s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.

![Social](https://www.incapsula.com/web-application-security/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/social-engineering.png)

What makes social engineering especially dangerous is that it relies on human error, rather than vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Mistakes made by legitimate users are much less predictable, making them harder to identify and thwart than a malware-based intrusion.

**SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACK TECHNIQUES**

Social engineering attacks come in many different forms and can be performed anywhere where human interaction is involved. The following are the five most common forms of digital social engineering assaults.

**Baiting**
As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victim’s greed or curiosity. They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their systems with malware.

The most reviled form of baiting uses physical media to disperse malware. For example, attackers leave the bait—typically malware-infected flash drives—in conspicuous areas where potential victims are certain to see them (e.g., bathrooms, elevators, the parking lot of a targeted company). The bait has an authentic look to it, such as a label presenting it as the company’s payroll list.

Victims pick up the bait out of curiosity and insert it into a work or home computer, resulting in automatic malware installation on the system.

Baiting scams don’t necessarily have to be carried out in the physical world. Online forms of baiting consist of enticing ads that lead to malicious sites or that encourage users to download a malware-infected application.

**Scareware**
Scareware involves victims being bombarded with false alarms and fictitious threats. Users are deceived to think their system is infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is malware itself. Scareware is also referred to as deception software, rogue scanner software and fraudware.

A common scareware example is the legitimate-looking popup banners appearing in your browser while surfing the web, displaying such text such as, “Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs.” It either offers to install the tool (often malware-infected) for you, or will direct you to a malicious site where your computer becomes infected.

Scareware is also distributed via spam email that doles out bogus warnings, or makes offers for users to buy worthless/harmful services.

**Pretexting**
Here an attacker obtains information through a series of cleverly crafted lies. The scam is often initiated by a perpetrator pretending to need sensitive information from a victim so as to perform a critical task.

The attacker usually starts by establishing trust with their victim by impersonating co-workers, police, bank and tax officials, or other persons who have right-to-know authority. The pretexter asks questions that are ostensibly required to confirm the victim’s identity, through which they gather important personal data.

All sorts of pertinent information and records is gathered using this scam, such as social security numbers, personal addresses and phone numbers, phone records, staff vacation dates, bank records and even security information related to a physical plant.

**Phishing**
As one of the most popular social engineering attack types, phishing scams are email and text message campaigns aimed at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims. It then prods them into revealing sensitive information, clicking on links to malicious websites, or opening attachments that contain malware.

An **example** is an email sent to users of an online service that alerts them of a policy violation requiring immediate action on their part, such as a required password change. It includes a link to an illegitimate website—nearly identical in appearance to its legitimate version—prompting the unsuspecting user to enter their current credentials and new password. Upon form submittal the information is sent to the attacker.

Given that identical, or near-identical, messages are sent to all users in phishing campaigns, detecting and blocking them are much easier for mail servers having access to threat sharing platforms.

**Spear phishing**
This is a more targeted version of the phishing scam whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or enterprises. They then tailor their messages based on characteristics, job positions, and contacts belonging to their victims to make their attack less conspicuous. Spear phishing requires much more effort on behalf of the perpetrator and may take weeks and months to pull off. They’re much harder to detect and have better success rates if done skillfully.

A spear phishing scenario might involve an attacker who, in impersonating an organization’s IT consultant, sends an email to one or more employees. It’s worded and signed exactly as the consultant normally does, thereby deceiving recipients into thinking it’s an authentic message. The message prompts recipients to change their password and provides them with a link that redirects them to a malicious page where the attacker now captures their credentials.

**SOCIAL ENGINEERING PREVENTION**
Social engineers manipulate human feelings, such as curiosity or fear, to carry out schemes and draw victims into their traps. Therefore, be wary whenever you feel alarmed by an email, attracted to an offer displayed on a website, or when you come across stray digital media lying about. Being alert can help you protect yourself against most social engineering attacks taking place in the digital realm.

Moreover, the following tips can help improve your vigilance in relation to social engineering hacks.

- **Don’t open emails and attachments from suspicious sources** – If you don’t know the sender in question, you don’t need to answer an email. Even if you do know them and are suspicious about their message, cross-check and confirm the news from other sources, such as via telephone or directly from a service provider’s site. Remember that email addresses are spoofed all of the time; even an email purportedly coming from a trusted source may have actually been initiated by an attacker.

- **Use multifactor authentication** – One of the most valuable pieces of information attackers seek are user credentials. Using multifactor authentication helps ensure your account’s protection in the event of system compromise. Imperva Login Protect is an easy-to-deploy 2FA solution that can increase account security for your applications.

- **Be wary of tempting offers** – If an offer sounds too enticing, think twice before accepting it as fact. Googling the topic can help you quickly determine whether you’re dealing with a legitimate offer or a trap.

- **Keep your antivirus/antimalware software updated** – Make sure automatic updates are engaged, or make it a habit to download the latest signatures first thing each day. Periodically check to make sure that the updates have been applied, and scan your system for possible infections.

## Symmetric Encryption

**Definition - What does Symmetric Encryption mean?**

Symmetric encryption is a form of computerized cryptography using a singular encryption key to guise an electronic message. Its data conversion uses a mathematical algorithm along with a secret key, which results in the inability to make sense out of a message. Symmetric encrpytion is a two-way algorithm because the mathematical algorithm is reversed when decrypting the message along with using the same secret key.

Symmetric encryption is also known as private-key encryption and secure-key encryption.

**Techopedia explains Symmetric Encryption**

The two types of symmetric encryptions are done using block and stream algorithms. Block algorithms are applied to blocks of electronic data. Specified set lengths of bits are transformed, while simultaneously using the selected secret key. This key is then applied to each block. However, when network stream data is being encrypted, the encryption system holds the data in its memory components waiting for the blocks in their entirety. The time in which the system waits can yield a definite security gap, and may compromise data protection. The solution involves a process where the block of data could be lessened and combined with previous encrypted data block contents until the rest of the blocks arrive. This is known as feedback. When the entire block is received, then it is encrypted.

Conversely, stream algorithms are not held in the encryption system memory, but arrive in data stream algorithms. This type of algorithm is considered somewhat more secure, since a disk or system is not holding on to the data without encryption in the memory components.
