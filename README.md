> Definition of 'Hacking'

  - **Definition:** Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose.


## Know yourself - The Threat and Vulnerable Landscape

> Goal

- Foundation Principle of Securities privacy and anonymity. how this principle applies to any given situation and yours personally so you can asses select implement and monitor appropriate security
control to reduce risk . you will understand the relationship between security privacy and anonymity.


> What is Privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity

## Privacy

- which is why some of your assets are important to you. you may want to keep your email private or you may want to keep your identity remain unknown.
privacy is the state of being free from public attention.
but that doesn't mean people don't know you.

``OR``

- the right that someone has to keep their personal life or personal information secret or known only to a small group of people:

``Some Example``

  - You can close this curtain to give you a little more privacy.
  - an invasion of privacy
  - Patients' names have been changed to protect their privacy.
  - I would appreciate it if you would respect my privacy.
  - Famous people often find their privacy is invaded by the press.


## Anonymity

  - When nobody knows who you are but potentially seeing what you do. Anonymity keeps your action and activities separate from your real identity.

  - **nonu[U]** a situation in which a person is not known by or spoken of by name


## Pseudonymity

  - false identity as simple as that.

  - Pseudonymity, a word derived from pseudonym, meaning 'false name', is a state of disguised identity. The pseudonym identifies a holder, that is, one or more human beings who possess but do not disclose their true names (that is, legal identities).

> on of the most Pseudonymitest of modern time is [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) the **creator** of Bitcoin. - on wikipedia

# Security Vulnerabilities Threats and Adversaries (Bookmarked)

  - Now though you know the privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity and that's bring us to **SECURITY**

> ASSETS 

  - The things we really care about and for protecting our assets we use various securities control.
meaning security is degree to which our assets are resistance to **THREATS** from our **ADVERSARIES**
and we select security control based on the type of threads and the adversary that we face
threads are bad things that can happen like a malware attack or mass survalence etc.. all are given ðŸ‘‡ in image
and these threats are enable by our adversaries which might be hackers cyber criminals etc etc.. 

and you can see those red tringle on the image those are vulnerability bugs and witnesses in your security controls a threats will try to expose vulnerability in your security to impact your assest.

**for example**

  - Malware infect your computer through the vulnerability of being on **PATCHED**

> here is the formule

``` Risk = (Vulnerabilities X Threats X Consequences) ``` 

  - will be a way to represent in a formula that likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerability in your security controls and Consequences of that is know as **RISK**. Risk to your assest and risk to you. and the threats and **ADVERSARIES** you face these are called your threats landscape. your threats will be individual to you so as you can clearly see security does not absolutely not exist in isolation so your security controls will selected on the base of 
to mitigate the threats and adversaries and the Consequences of that realisation 

**for exapmle** 

  - you might select **TOR** as a security control to help mitigate threat or mass survalance from **Oppressive Regimes**
or you might choose **TOR** because the Consequences are high in terms of your identity and once your identity is know your Consequences will be realised so you most implement security control to protect your assets to ensure privacy and anonymity and pseudonymity if you require it.

    - Security is a technology
    - Security is an action
    - Security is a process

# Threat Modelling and Risk Assessments


before moving forward lets clear these Core points

  - **Vulnerability:** In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a Threat Actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness..

  - **Threat:** A threat, in the context of computer security, refers to anything that has the potential to cause serious harm to a computer system. A threat is something that may or may not happen, but has the potential to cause serious damage. Threats can lead to attacks on computer systems, networks and more.

  - **Consequences** Consequences. To every action identified as a crime come the penalties or consequences stipulated by law. The penalties are stipulated according to the degree of damage deemed resultant from the crime. The hacking is punished under the statutes for computer criminal acts.

  - **Adversaries** [read here](http://www.centurylink.com/business/enterprise/blog/thinkgig/four-types-cybersecurity-adversaries-defend/)

**First thing First** You can not have a 100% Security Just like you never have 0% Risk you can never completely protect your assets
or maintain perfect privacy and have total anon and have you seen anyone who has 100% security than they simply lying to you.

![Risk Assessments](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Threat%20Modeling%20and%20Risk%20Assessments.png)

every where is risk and the problem is engaging with network is risk engaging with people has a risk.

we take these risk with great Opportunity and benefits so the Internet brings. in order to exploit the Opportunity of using the internet we have  to accept a level of risk. and you need to personally decide what is your tolerance to risk based on your circumstances the lower tolerance risk you have
i.e. if the consequences of loss of security privacy or anonymity is high than the more security control you need. the more advance and optimal
restricted to usability security controls you will want. the higher tolerance risk you have i.e. the consequences might be low the less security control you need. so the security is balance between usability and security between risk and opportunity and security often gets into the way of ease of use
which is why we most choose Security controls that fits our purpose and inline with our appetite risk.

you should take always risk based approach to your securities. we know we can't have 100% security. to apply the right level security
to mitigate the risk to be overburden point where system is unusable. the only you can choose how big burdensome your security needs to be protect your assets. in order to take risk based approach to security than you should do basic threat modelling and risk Assessments when selecting your security controls so, Lets go Through so Assessments process now.

> RISK = (vulnerabilities X Threat X Consequences)

1.  Assets - you should have list of your assets that you want to protect
2.  Vulnerabilities
3.  Threats - you must have some understanding of what Threats are.
4.  Adversaries - you must have some understanding of what Adversaries are.
5.  Consequences - determining the consequences of assets being compromise of threats being realise. when it comes to your assets consider lost or stolen destroyed or encrypted so you cant use them placed on the internet puts in the hands of your adversaries, criminals hackers how could impact your reputation , your privacy your anonymity will be loss. focus on **consequences** if you threat and adversaries are less tangible.

> security controls  we will see later

1.  Select
2.  Implement
3.  Assess
4.  Monitor


# Security vs Privacy vs Anonymity  - Can we have it all

Can some time being contradiction to each other for Example:-

a feature in your browser might check every site that you visit to see if its a know malware distribution site
this feature helps securities because it stops you going to those site which content malware. but can potentially interfere
your privacy and Anonymity as the site malware distribution site is maintaining contact with your browser and could be constaintely updating on what sites that you are vising and when.

the amount of privacy and Anonymity you require is directly prepositional to the amount of security you need.
the more privacy and Anonymity the more security controls

![ImageQuote](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Security%20vs%20Privacy%20vs%20Anonymity%20%20-%20Can%20we%20have%20it%20all.png)

# Defence In Depth

there is a principle in security called **Defence In Depth**.
The Idea is to provide layers of Defences so, one defence fails the other defence
protects you in its place.
so there are three main types of defence that you can think of

![Defence in Depth](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Defence%20in%20Depth.png)

1.  Prevent - this for example can be if you encrypt your files and make sure the key or password isn't available so the **Prevent Defence**
stop people compromising those files and accessing critical information.

2.  Detection  - Detection could be cannery which is planting a divert trap  to the hacker or malware triggers this cannery or trap so you notified that something is the mess

3.  Recovery  - Recovery is like backup or having a ability to Recovery lost file or lost account the principle is what
you cannot Prevent you detect and what you cannot detect you Recover.


> all you need is right technology and the right place

# The Zero Trust Model

Who and what you trust is the key for your security, privacy and anonymity. the less you trust the lower your risk. you want to minimize the number of things that you trust including yourself. This is the **ZERO TRUST MODEL**. To protect your Assets we have to make choice's about trust we have to select software, o/s, encryptions, storage, ISP, Password Manager what download you wanna download and even people that we have to trust to protect our Assets Evaluate Instead of trusting. every thing will represent a level of risk some acceptable and some of 'em not. we can mitigate the risk by distributing the trust this is the zero trust Model. Its should be applied everything we go through in this Tutorial

Trust nothing Trust No one Just evaluate and distribute the trust. well what is that really means!


**for Example**

  - say you want to save file online. you want to sync your file online than first you need to select providers that offer the syncing service
    - Dropbox - is a popular choice for most of people. still you should not trust that they will not get hacked. you should not trust that they wont view your file. you should not trust that they will lose or change your file. so you have to make a risk base choice based on that zero trust model
  - you should ask yourself how important is it that the file remain private without being changed and will always available. you decide that it is important so you choose that backup of the file as well in a separate location and encrypt the file with use a service to encrypt the files client side with a decryption key the only you have this way you have distributed the trust to the alternative backup and to yourself by encryptions

  - Crypton & ENCRYPTR are called Zero Knowledge System. Zero knowledge meaning when provider has zero knowledge about what it is that they are hosting for there client

  [Let us see an example] -> applications can have secrete backdoors you may choose to run an application in a isolated virtual machine to stop it being able to communicated out. application can have malwares again it may sandbox that application instead of trusting in your evaluating you mitigating the risk by distributing the trust.

# If Thereâ€™s Value, They Will Hack It

Have you ever wondered what a hacked computer, email address, or other online account is even worth? Sure, it seems pretty obvious that thereâ€™d be some serious value in a compromised online bank or PayPal account, but what about Facebook or Skype or any of the other myriad of online services?

![Hack](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2013/06/05095329/value_title.jpg)

There are at least two ways in which we can enumerate this value. One of those ways is financial: what is the market value of a hacked account? However, these accounts are also valuable for their worth to social engineers. In other words, how can they be used in phishing attacks designed to compromise the other things that criminals compromise?

Lucky for us, Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter and one of the most well-respected journalists in the industry, published a chart illustrating the value of hacked machines a few years back on his own news site, **Krebs on Security**. He has revisited the idea a few times including an evaluation of the values of hacked email and other accounts. Following Krebsâ€™ lead, **the SANS Institute has elaborated on this idea in a whole slew of languages**. The SANS chart is below:

![chart](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2013/06/05095326/STH-Poster-YouAreATarget-LowResolution.jpg)

Letâ€™s start with the direct financial value of various accounts estimated by Krebsâ€™s based on his tendency to trawl through the sketchy black-market forums in which they are sold. He claims that a prominent seller of this stuff charges $8 for iTunes accounts; $6 for Fedex.com, Continental.com, and United.com accounts; $5 for Groupon accounts; $4 for Godaddy accounts; and a measly $2.50 for active Facebook and Twitter accounts. Iâ€™m sure these prices jump a bit if the accounts belong to valuable targets, like diplomats, prominent business people, celebrities, defense contractors, and others. In a separate piece based on a different marketplace, Krebs found Dell, Overstock, Walmart, Tesco, BestBuy, Target and other online retail accounts worth between $1 and $3.

The funny thing about hacked PayPal and online bank accounts is that their value isnâ€™t as straight forward as you might think. Letâ€™s say youâ€™ve got $2000 in a bank account or on a credit card or available on PayPal. The value of that account would be two grand, right? Not really. The criminals that compromise these accounts do it on a wholesale level. They usually arenâ€™t compromising and emptying the accounts themselves. To do so is simply too labor intensive and too risky. Instead, they hack the account, and sell access to it on these same underground, black-market forums.

> A criminal with access to your primary email account can likely reset the passwords to and take control of every other account you own.

Another popular way to make money on a compromised financial account is to use money mules. In these cases your account is pretty much worth whatâ€™s in it, but itâ€™s kind of a different animal altogether. Very briefly, money mule operators put out advertisements offering easy money to anyone that will remove money from a bank account and wire it off to wherever the criminal is located. The crooks running these scams arenâ€™t advertising for money mules, but the people that accept these offers are, without their knowledge, acting as money mules. Oftentimes they are not paid after withdrawing and moving the money.

Email and financial accounts are harder to evaluate because much of their value depends upon the contents of the accounts and the identity of their rightful owner, which makes this a pretty good place to transition into the non-financial value of hacked accounts. Email accounts are often the hub through which every other account is controlled. When you forget a password, you reset it through your email account. My passwords are often so unique and so good that I have no option but to reset them through my email because Iâ€™ll never remember them otherwise.

A hacked email account is also a danger to every single one of your contacts. The same logic can be applied to your various social media accounts. These people you connect with trust you. If a malicious link comes in a phishing email from a known email account, your contacts or friends or connections will probably open it, and that is on you. Youâ€™ll have to live with the fact that your lazy security practices sunk someone elseâ€™s ship and I hope you lose sleep over it! Just kidding, I hope you practice strong security and never run into these problems.

## Top 10 Internet Safety Rules & What Not to Do Online

![chartWhatExpertsSaysAndNonExpertsSays](https://github.com/Ryanhustler420/Network_Hacking-/blob/master/assets/Top%203%20Rules.png)

1. Keep Personal Information Professional and Limited
Potential employers or customers don't need to know your personal relationship status or your home address. They do need to know about your expertise and professional background, and how to get in touch with you. You wouldn't hand purely personal information out to strangers individuallyâ€”don't hand it out to millions of people online.

2. Keep Your Privacy Settings On
Marketers love to know all about you, and so do hackers. Both can learn a lot from your browsing and social media usage. But you can take charge of your information. As noted by Lifehacker, both web browsers and mobile operating systems have settings available to protect your privacy online. Major websites like Facebook also have privacy-enhancing settings available. These settings are sometimes (deliberately) hard to find because companies want your personal information for its marketing value. Make sure you have enabled these privacy safeguards, and keep them enabled.

3. Practice Safe Browsing
You wouldn't choose to walk through a dangerous neighborhoodâ€”don't visit dangerous neighborhoods online. Cybercriminals use lurid content as bait. They know people are sometimes tempted by dubious content and may let their guard down when searching for it. The Internet's demimonde is filled with hard-to-see pitfalls, where one careless click could expose personal data or infect your device with malware. By resisting the urge, you don't even give the hackers a chance.

4. Make Sure Your Internet Connection is Secure
When you go online in a public place, for example by using a public Wi-Fi connection, PCMag notes you have no direct control over its security. Corporate cybersecurity experts worry about "endpoints"â€”the places where a private network connects to the outside world. Your vulnerable endpoint is your local Internet connection. Make sure your device is secure, and when in doubt, wait for a better time (i.e., until you're able to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network) before providing information such as your bank account number.

5. Be Careful What You Download
A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malwareâ€”programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. As PCWorld advises, don't download apps that look suspicious or come from a site you don't trust.

6. Choose Strong Passwords
Passwords are one of the biggest weak spots in the whole Internet security structure, but there's currently no way around them. And the problem with passwords is that people tend to choose easy ones to remember (such as "password" and "123456"), which are also easy for cyber thieves to guess. Select strong passwords that are harder for cybercriminals to demystify. Password manager software can help you to manage multiple passwords so that you don't forget them. A strong password is one that is unique and complexâ€”at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special characters.

7. Make Online Purchases From Secure Sites
Any time you make a purchase online, you need to provide credit card or bank account informationâ€”just what cybercriminals are most eager to get their hands on. Only supply this information to sites that provide secure, encrypted connections. As Boston University notes, you can identify secure sites by looking for an address that starts with https: (the S stands for secure) rather than simply http: They may also be marked by a padlock icon next to the address bar.

8. Be Careful What You Post
The Internet does not have a delete key, as that young candidate in New Hampshire found out. Any comment or image you post online may stay online forever because removing the original (say, from Twitter) does not remove any copies that other people made. There is no way for you to "take back" a remark you wish you hadn't made, or get rid of that embarrassing selfie you took at a party. Don't put anything online that you wouldn't want your mom or a prospective employer to see.

9. Be Careful Who You Meet Online
People you meet online are not always who they claim to be. Indeed, they may not even be real. As InfoWorld reports, fake social media profiles are a popular way for hackers to cozy up to unwary Web users and pick their cyber pockets. Be as cautious and sensible in your online social life as you are in your in-person social life.

10. Keep Your Antivirus Program Up To Date
Internet security software cannot protect against every threat, but it will detect and remove most malwareâ€”though you should make sure it's to date. Be sure to stay current with your operating system's updates and updates to applications you use. They provide a vital layer of security.

Keep these 10 basic Internet safety rules in mind and you'll avoid many of the nasty surprises that lurk online for the careless.

# Security Bugs and Vulnerabilities

Security bug. A security bug or security defect is a software bug that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or privileges on a computer system. Security bugs introduce security vulnerabilities by compromising one or more of: Authentication of users and other entities. [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_bug)
