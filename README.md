> Definition of 'Hacking'

  - **Definition:** Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose.


# Know yourself - The Threat and Vulnerable Landscape

> Goal

- Foundation Principle of Securities privacy and anonymity. how this principle applies to any given situation and yours personally so you can asses select implement and monitor appropriate security
control to reduce risk . you will understand the relationship between security privacy and anonymity.


> What is Privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity

## Privacy

- which is why some of your assets are important to you. you may want to keep your email private or you may want to keep your identity remain unknown.
privacy is the state of being free from public attention.
but that doesn't mean people don't know you.

``OR``

- the right that someone has to keep their personal life or personal information secret or known only to a small group of people:

``Some Example``

  - You can close this curtain to give you a little more privacy.
  - an invasion of privacy
  - Patients' names have been changed to protect their privacy.
  - I would appreciate it if you would respect my privacy.
  - Famous people often find their privacy is invaded by the press.


## Anonymity

  - When nobody knows who you are but potentially seeing what you do. Anonymity keeps your action and activities separate from your real identity.

  - **nonu[U]** a situation in which a person is not known by or spoken of by name


## Pseudonymity

  - false identity as simple as that.

  - Pseudonymity, a word derived from pseudonym, meaning 'false name', is a state of disguised identity. The pseudonym identifies a holder, that is, one or more human beings who possess but do not disclose their true names (that is, legal identities).

> on of the most Pseudonymitest of modern time is [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) the **creator** of Bitcoin. - on wikipedia

# Security Vulnerabilities Threats and Adversaries (Bookmarked)

  - Now though you know the privacy Anonymity and Pseudonymity and that's bring us to **SECURITY**

> ASSETS 

  - The things we really care about and for protecting our assets we use various securities control.
meaning security is degree to which our assets are resistance to **THREATS** from our **ADVERSARIES**
and we select security control based on the type of threads and the adversary that we face
threads are bad things that can happen like a malware attack or mass survalence etc.. all are given ðŸ‘‡ in image
and these threats are enable by our adversaries which might be hackers cyber criminals etc etc.. 

and you can see those red tringle on the image those are vulnerability bugs and witnesses in your security controls a threats will try to expose vulnerability in your security to impact your assest.

**for example**

  - Malware infect your computer through the vulnerability of being on **PATCHED**

> here is the formule

``` Risk = (Vulnerabilities X Threats X Consequences) ``` 

  - will be a way to represent in a formula that likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerability in your security controls and Consequences of that is know as **RISK**. Risk to your assest and risk to you. and the threats and **ADVERSARIES** you face these are called your threats landscape. your threats will be individual to you so as you can clearly see security does not absolutely not exist in isolation so your security controls will selected on the base of 
to mitigate the threats and adversaries and the Consequences of that realisation 

**for exapmle** 

  - you might select **TOR** as a security control to help mitigate threat or mass survalance from **Oppressive Regimes**
or you might choose **TOR** because the Consequences are high in terms of your identity and once your identity is know your Consequences will be realised so you most implement security control to protect your assets to ensure privacy and anonymity and pseudonymity if you require it.

    - Security is a technology
    - Security is an action
    - Security is a process
